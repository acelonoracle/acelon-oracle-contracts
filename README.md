Currently, the available smart contracts / pallets are:

- [EVM](evm): an EVM implementation that can be used on any EVM compatible chain.
- [ink!](ink): an [ink!](https://use.ink/) implementation that can be deployed on any substrate chain that includes the [Contract Module](https://crates.io/crates/pallet-contracts).
- [Substrate Pallet](substrate-pallet): a substrate pallet implementation that can be integrated in a substrate based chain.
